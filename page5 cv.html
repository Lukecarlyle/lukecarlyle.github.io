<IMG SRC="migos.jpg" align="left" width="450" height="450">
<H2> The Migos are my favorite rap group. They have three very creative rappers that are changing the style of rap. <I>Quavo, Offset, Takeoff </I>  are taking over and changing the culture.<H2>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="quavo.jpg" align="left" width="600" height="400">
<h2> Quavo or also known as Huncho, Is the leader of the group. He has some incredible verses and has the best jewlery in the rap game.</h2>
<HR>
<IMG SRC="offset.jpg" align="left" width="800" height="400">
<h3>Offset used to be my favorite rapper in the group. He could change his flow like no one else. He isn't my favorite any more because he is dating Carti B and she is the worst.</h3>
<hr>
<IMG SRC="takeoff.jpg" align="left">
<h4> Takeoff is the least popular in the group but I still like him. He doesn't have a ton of great songs out and does not release as much msuic as the other two but Takeoff is still a key part in the group.</h4>
